# Introduction

Use the IBM Planning Analytics Workspace UI API to return generated Planning Analytics Workspace assets. You can return assets such as cube views, the dimension editor, the set editor, and TM1 views.

The Planning Analytics Workspace UI API is developed and built using the <a href='https://github.com/nestjs/nest'>Nest</a> framework.

Some code examples contain `http(s)://<Planning Analytics Workspace URL>`. If you are using these code examples, be sure to replace `<Planning Analytics Workspace URL>` with your own Planning Analytics Workspace URL.
